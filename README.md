Boho Bistro is a restaurant website project that was originally built with static **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.  
We are converting it into a **React.js frontend** with a **Node.js + Express backend** to make it more dynamic and modular.

---

## 🚀 Features
- React frontend with multiple pages (`Home`, `Menu`, `Reservation`, `Contact Us`)
- Node.js + Express backend serving API routes
- Dummy API endpoints for menu items and reservations
- Responsive design using Bootstrap

---

## 📡 API Endpoints
- `GET /api/menu-items` → Returns a list of menu items (dummy data)  
- `POST /api/reservation` → Accepts reservation details (dummy response)  

---

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
